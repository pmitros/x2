    <h1> Part-2: Calculating the Z-score </h1>

    <ol>

            <li>
                Now that we know the distribution of the class average, we can find the probability
                of obtaining a class average at least as good as the one observed (S=543). However, to do so right away we
                will have to do some tedious algebra involving <b>S</b>. We could skip the tedious algebra
                by using a z-score table, but first we have to
                transform S into a new <b>Standard</b> Normal random variable. In other words we
                are looking for a function <b>f</b> such that:
                <br />
                <b>f(S)~N(0,1)</b>
            </li>

            <li>
                Now that you have <b>f(S)</b> plug in the observed value of <b>S=543</b> in <b>f(S)</b> , to obtain what's known as the <b>Z-score</b>

                <br />
                <b>Answer: </b> Z-score =
                <input type="text" id="input_zscore" value="{{ input.input_zscore.val }}" />
                <button input_src="input_zscore" class='check_button'>check</button>


            </li>

        </ol>
    </p>
