        The nation average SAT score in Mathematics is <b> μ=514 </b> with
        standard deviation of <b> σ=117 </b>.
        A math teacher in Springfield High has a class of <b> 30 students </b>who
        have received scores as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
    <table border=1px>
        <tr>
            <td>Student 1</td>
            <td>544</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Student 2</td>
            <td>590</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>...</td>
            <td>...</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Student 30</td>
            <td>522</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>class average</td>
            <td>S=543</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>

        The teacher wants to find out whether his students were better than
        average,
        which would mean that he did a good job teaching. He calculates the
        average
        score of his class, let's call it the "class average": <b>S=543</b>,
        which is obviously higher than the nation average <b>μ=514.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the teacher is still not convinced. He is worried that the
        higher scores
        might be a fluke due to randomness, and that his students are actually
        average. What
        the teacher wants to calculate is the probability that if the students
        are indeed average
        they will get scores at least as good as the ones they got. In
        statistics this probability
        is called a p-value. If the p-value is sufficiently small (less than
        0.05), we will reject the
        hypothesis that the students are average, which in our case would mean
        that they are better.
    </p>


    <p>
        We calculate the p-value using the following steps:
    <ol>
        <li>Assume that students were indeed average in the sense that each
            student's score
            came from a normal distribution: <b>N(μ=514, σ²=117²)</b></li>
        <li>
            Derive the sampling distribution of the class average: <b>S</b>
            (Hint: think of the central limit theorem).
            <br/>
            <b> Answer </b>: the distribution is Normal with:
            <br/>

            mean = <input type="text" id="input_mean"
                          value="{{ input.input_mean.val }}"/>
            <button input_src="input_mean" class='check_button'>check</button>
            <br/>
            variance = <input type=text id="input_var"
                              value="{{ input.input_var.val }}"/>
            <button input_src="input_var" class='check_button'>check</button>
        </li>

    </ol>
    </p>
