    Statistical significance tests help us solve problems like the following:

        The average SAT score in Mathematics is 514 with standard deviation of Ïƒ=117.
        A math teacher in Springfield High has a class of six students who have received the following scores:

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Student A</td><td>544</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Student B</td><td>590</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Student C</td><td>560</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Student D</td><td>510</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Student E</td><td>549</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Student F</td><td>505</td>
            </tr>

        The teacher wants to find out whether his students were better than average,
        which would mean that he did a good job teaching. He calculates the average
        score of his class, 543, which is obviously higher than the nation average of 514.

        However, the teacher is still not convinced. He is worried that the higher scores
        might be a fluke due to randomness, and that his students are actually average. What
        the teacher wants to calculate is the probability that if the students are truly average
        they will receive the scores they did. In statistics this probability is called a p-value.

        To compute the p-value
